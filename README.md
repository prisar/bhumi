open information of various plots, connectivity and cell towers of deogaon village. aim is to 
provide comprehensive tool to anyone interested in the village of kaliyaganj or similar.
the tools included are google earth pro, map files and images from various sources. apart from that many 
plots are marked with colors and lines to understand the network connectivity.

to give a brackground about the village i should started with it's location. deogaon is a remote 
village within 5 kms from bangladesh border. it is 2 kms from a railway station called dalimgaon. 
major railway stations includes radhikapur and kaliyaganj. These stations are connected with 
major cities like Kolkata, Siliguri, Howrah, Delhi.

there are lot of difficulties like infrastructure, supply, raw materials, etc. still i believe that most of 
the challenges can be addressed and benifits can be ripped with projects operating here.
